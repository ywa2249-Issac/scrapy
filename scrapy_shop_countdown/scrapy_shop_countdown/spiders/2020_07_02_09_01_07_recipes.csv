Cut the pastry sheets to be around 25% larger than the tine you plan to use. I found that when I cut my pastry exactly to size it shrunk a whole heap which is not ideal. You might need to stick two sheets together to get the right length. Place the pastry (still half frozen) on a dampened baking tray lined with baking paper (sprinkle a bit of water on with your fingers). Prick all over the sheets with a fork. Bake for 10 minutes, take out of the oven, flip the sheets over, return to the oven and bake for another 5 minutes, or until both sides are nice and golden. Leave the sheets to cool.;To make the custard:;In a medium sized sauce pan over a medium heat, warm the milk until it just starts to bubble at the edges, do not boil.;In a large bowl, beat together the castor sugar, eggs (both whole and yolk) and vanilla until the mixture is very thick and pale. Sift in the flour and beat until evenly incorporated.;Pour the warm milk into a jug and gradually pour the milk into the egg and sugar mixture whilst continuously beating on low. Beat until everything is evenly mixed.;Return this mixture to the sauce pan.;Heat the custard on a medium to low heat, stirring continuously and making sure the bottom and corners of the pan are well scraped with heat stir. Stir until the custard becomes nice and thick. I found this to be somewhere around four and seven minutes. It should be quite pasty and gloopy when it is ready. When you scrap the bottom of the pan you should be able to see the bottom of the pan for a second before the custard runs back over it. Take the custard off the heat.;Line your slice tin with baking paper.;Place one of the pastry sheets on the bottom. Pour over the custard and spread over evenly. Place the second sheet over the top. If the sheets don’t end up fitting the tin because they are too bit just use a nice big knife to slice them down to size.;Place the tin in the fridge for an hour or so.;Cream together the icing ingredients adding enough milk so that it beats together nicely and makes a smooth and fluffy icing.;Spread the icing over the top sheet of pastry, don’t worry about it being super smooth and flat, imperfect is the new perfect!;Return to the fridge for another 20 minutes to set the icing a little more.;Carefully transfer the custard slab onto a chopping board.

Carefully using a very sharp knife, slice into the side of the breast approx. 1 cm from the top and slice approximately 3/4 of the way through horizontally, but do not slice it all the way. Repeat with the remaining chicken breasts and set aside.;5. Once the spinach is almost cooled, add in feta, grated cheese and a pinch of salt and pepper and stir well to combine.;6. To stuff the chicken, open the sliced chicken breast and take a scoop of mixture and place this in the centre of the breast (be generous with the stuffing, but ensure the lid will still close) and close the chicken lid.;7. Take a strip of bacon and start by placing one end underneath the thickest end of the breast, then carefully wrap the bacon around the chicken, careful not to overlap too much, ending underneath again or tucking the end of the bacon into the strip next to it. To wrap the chicken, you will need 2-3 strips of bacon per chicken breast.;8. Repeat with the strips of bacon until the chicken breast is covered and all the ends are underneath the chicken. Place in the prepared baking dish and repeat with the remaining chicken.;9. Bake for 50-60 minutes (the timing will depend on the size of the chicken breasts) or until the bacon is golden and the chicken is fully cooked. Test with a knife, the chicken should no longer be pink and the juices should run clear. Remove from the oven and allow to stand for 5 minutes before serving;10. Serve with salad, roast vegetables or fragrant coriander rice and enjoy!;We've teamed up with Anna from Just a Mum to bring you this recipe.

"2.2 - 2.8 kg Leg pork, bone in, skin on and scored (get your butcher to do this);1/4 cup Olive oil;2 tsp Sea salt;2 tsp Fennel seeds;2 tbsp Chopped rosemary;4 - 6 Cloves of garlic;2 large Onions, peeled and quartered;1 1/2 cups Selaks Reserve Pinot Gris;8 - 10 small Granny smith apples (or one per person);Salt & pepper to season gravy","• Preheat the oven to 250°C. Rub the skin and the flesh of the pork with olive oil, salt, fennel seeds and chopped rosemary. Place in a roasting dish large enough so there’s room for the whole apples part way through cooking. Roast at a high heat to get the crackle started – be patient, this can take up to 45 minutes before it is browned and blistered enough to make great crackling. Keep an eye on it to ensure it crackles but doesn’t burn. Reduce the oven temperature to 180°C. Add one cup of the wine to the dish, scatter onions and garlic cloves around pork, then cover with foil and cook for 60 minutes. Using a sharp knife, score the apples around the ‘waist’ to stop them bursting while cooking. Remove the roasting dish from the oven and remove the foil (carefully to avoid steam burns). Add the apples to the dish, baste each one with the roasting juices and add a sprinkle of salt.;• Continue cooking for a further 30 minutes, uncovered, until the apples and pork are cooked through, the crackling will crisp up again during this time too. Prick meat with a sharp knife - if the juices run clear, it’s done; if not, pop it back in the oven for another 10 -15 minutes. Remove from the oven and remove the pork and apples carefully from the roasting dish. Set aside for the pork to rest for 10 minutes while you make the gravy. To make gravy, pour away most of the fat from the roasting dish and add the remaining half cup of white wine. Simmer until the liquid has reduced by half. Add half a cup of water and scrape all the gooey goodness off the bottom of the roasting dish, simmer and season with salt and pepper to taste. Pass this through a sieve into a serving jug.;• Serve sliced pork with cooked apples and gravy.",https://shop.countdown.co.nz/shop/recipe/2132?name=roast-pork-leg-with-apple-fennel-crackle
